//! `learn retro-link` subcommand. Patches a specific corner of the
//! `(finding, canonical_semantic)` link grid that the regular global
//! `learn link` pass can't reach.
//!
//! # Why this command exists — responsibility table
//!
//! Each (finding, canonical_semantic) pair in the historical KG must be
//! judged by the LLM exactly once. Two separate passes cover the four
//! quadrants of "is the finding/semantic newly admitted this run or
//! already in the KG":
//!
//! | | **new finding** (this learn run) | **old finding** (already in `finding_link_status`) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **new canonical semantic** (this learn run) | `learn link` | **`learn retro-link`** |
//! | **old canonical semantic** (already in the KG) | `learn link` | covered by that finding's earlier learn run |
//!
//! `learn link` ([`crate::cmd::learn::link::LinkArgs`]) iterates findings
//! that do NOT yet have a `finding_link_status` row and judges them against
//! [`HistoricalDatabase::all_canonical_semantic_link_candidates`] — i.e.
//! every canonical in the KG, old or new. So both "new finding × old
//! canonical" and "new finding × new canonical" land here naturally.
//!
//! `learn retro-link` covers the one remaining quadrant — **already-linked
//! findings against canonicals that were just introduced**. `learn link`
//! skips already-linked findings by design (`finding_link_status` is the
//! skip-list), so without `learn retro-link` this quadrant would silently
//! go un-judged in the incremental flow.
//!
//! `workflow learn`'s module doc labels these passes "Phase 2" (retro-link)
//! and "Phase 3" (link) for its own staging story; that labeling is local
//! to `workflow learn` and isn't part of the cross-command contract here.
//!
//! # When to call it
//!
//! - **Incremental learn** (`workflow learn` on top of an already-linked
//!   KG): MUST run this between admission and `learn link`. The new project
//!   introduces both new findings AND new canonicals, and the existing
//!   linked findings need a chance to bind to those new canonicals.
//!
//! - **Bulk learn** (`learn moves` / `learn c4` / `learn projects` on a
//!   fresh KG): NOT needed. There are no "old findings" yet — every
//!   finding flows through `learn link` and is judged against the full
//!   canonical set in one sweep. Running retro-link here is a no-op modulo
//!   budget burn.
//!
//! # Implementation note: the `pending_semantic` queue
//!
//! [`HistoricalDatabase::write_project_completed`] enqueues every
//! `MergeAction::New` canonical into `pending_semantic`. retro-link reads
//! the queue, fans out the LLM judgement over `pending × already_linked`,
//! then truncates the queue. The queue is just the mechanism for "which
//! canonicals are new this run"; the conceptual responsibility table
//! above is the invariant the queue serves.
