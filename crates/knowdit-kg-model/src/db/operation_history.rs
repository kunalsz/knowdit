//! Append-only audit log of top-level `knowdit learn` operations that mutate
//! the historical knowledge graph (currently `c4learn` and `link`).
//!
//! One row per DISTINCT `(type, args)`: the row is written only after the
//! operation's real work has fully committed, and the write is deduplicated on
//! `(type, args)` so re-running the same operation with byte-identical
//! arguments never appends a second row. `args` deliberately carries ONLY the
//! operation's tuning knobs (serialized from its CLI arg struct) — never LLM
//! credentials, filesystem paths, or any other sensitive input.
