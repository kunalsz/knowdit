Extract DeFi Semantics from the provided project material chunk.

### Definition of DeFi Semantic

A DeFi Semantic is defined by:
1. **Name:** A short, abstract, canonical name (e.g., "Constant Product AMM Swap", "Collateralized Debt Position Opening").
2. **Definition:** A one-sentence formal definition of this semantic.
3. **Description:** Concrete behavioural prose carrying the implementation details a future reader needs to recognise the same semantic in another project. **NOT** abstract metaphor like "manages user deposits". Whenever applicable from the actual source, include:
   - Critical state variables read or written, with the operation (e.g. "increments `s_depositedAssets` additively by the *requested* `assets` value, before calling `transferFrom`").
   - Access control: which role / modifier / `msg.sender` check gates each entry point.
   - External calls and their failure modes (revert / swallowed in try/catch / silently ignored).
   - Critical invariants the path enforces or violates (e.g. "reverts on `reserveX < amount`", "preserves `k = reserveX * reserveY` modulo fee").
   - Pre-condition state and post-condition state in concrete terms.

   Always say WHICH state variable, WITH WHAT semantics, WHO is allowed, WHEN the side effect happens, WHAT external boundaries are crossed. Aim for 4–8 sentences. Detail beats brevity.
4. **Functions:** The specific functions or entry points in the source code that implement this semantic. Use the containing file or module path in the `contract` field. At least one entry is required per semantic.
5. **Category:** Exactly one DeFi category, picked from the project's known categories above. Use `Others` only when none fit.

### Critical Rules

1. **Hard rule on abstraction.** In the `name`, `definition`, and `description` fields you MUST NOT include any of:
   - Specific protocol or project names (Uniswap, Aave, Compound, BentoBox, Tempus, Pendle, …).
   - Specific contract names (UniswapV2Pair, BentoBoxV1, …).
   - Specific function signatures or library APIs (`swap(...)`, `depositAndFix(...)`).
   - Specific branded asset names (USDC, DAI, stETH, …) — say "stablecoin", "wrapped staking receipt", etc.
   Use only abstract DeFi roles like "AMM swap helper", "external principal-token integration", "shared collateral vault", "yield strategy adapter", "liquidity-mining staker", "signature forwarder".
   - Bad: "Deposit into BentoBox to mint BentoShares"
   - Good: "Deposit into shared vault to mint unified liquidity shares"
   The `functions` field IS the place for project-specific implementation pointers and SHOULD keep the real contract path and function name.

2. **Use canonical DeFi vocabulary:** "liquidity provision", "collateralized debt position", "yield-bearing vault share", "constant-product swap", "concentrated liquidity range order", etc.

3. **Cluster every callable function or public entry point visible in this chunk** into a semantic — but cluster aggressively. Many functions in the same file usually map to the same DeFi semantic (e.g. `mint`, `burn`, `_mint`, `_burn` together = "Fungible Token Supply Adjustment"). The `functions` array is where you enumerate every member of a cluster; the *number of distinct semantics* should stay small. If a function does not correspond to any DeFi semantic (pure admin/governance, view-only getters, standard token boilerplate), put it under a single "Utility/Admin" semantic for this chunk — do not create one Utility/Admin semantic per file.

4. **Be thorough within this chunk** but stay project-agnostic. Subsequent chunks of the same project receive different code; cross-chunk merging will deduplicate later, so do not skip a real semantic just because it might appear elsewhere.

## Tool Usage

Use these tools to stream out the extraction (do NOT emit free-form JSON):
- `emit_semantic({{name, definition, description, category, functions: [{{name, contract, signature?}}, …]}})` — call once for each distinct DeFi Semantic you identify in this chunk. Cluster aggressively; emit one call per *distinct* semantic, with every same-meaning function listed inside `functions`.
- `finalize_semantic_extraction({{summary?}})` — call exactly once when this chunk has been fully covered (or when it contains no meaningful DeFi semantics — call finalize directly without any `emit_semantic`). After this, stop emitting tool calls.

## Instructions

The security report above has already been categorized under: {known_categories}

Extract Exploit Pattern Semantics from this security report.

### Definition of Exploit Pattern Semantic

An Exploit Pattern Semantic captures a reusable vulnerability mechanism — the abstract pattern that makes the exploit reproducible across different protocols.

1. **Name:** A short, canonical exploit pattern name. No protocol/contract/asset names.
   - Good: "Share Priced Against Subset of Total Value"
   - Good: "Reward Accounting via Unauthenticated balanceOf"
   - Good: "Sandwich Attack on Compounding Rebalance"
   - Bad: "Bankroll Vault Share Bug"

2. **Definition:** A one-sentence formal definition of this exploit pattern.

3. **Description:** Concrete prose describing the mechanism in 4-8 sentences. Include:
   - What invariant or assumption was violated
   - The specific accounting, call-ordering, or state-drift failure
   - What state variables or balances drift, how, and under what conditions
   - Attacker setup requirements (flash loan, specific preconditions, timing)
   - Downstream consequences of the exploit
   If the report cites specific code (state variables, function names, formulas), preserve those concrete details in the description — they make the pattern searchable. Detail beats brevity.

4. **Category:** Exactly one DeFi category, picked from the project's known categories above.
   This is the protocol's category (e.g. Lending, Dexes), not an exploit type.

5. **Functions:** Always emit at least one entry. If the report references specific contract functions,
   include them: `{{name: "<function>", contract: "<file or path>"}}`. If no specific functions
   are referenced, emit a sentinel: `{{name: "_narrative", contract: "<report_filename>"}}`.

### Critical Rules

1. **Hard rule on abstraction.** In the `name`, `definition`, and `description` fields you MUST NOT include:
   - Specific protocol/project names (Bankroll, PancakeSwap, Uniswap, Aave)
   - Specific contract names (VltUsdcVault, ZapHelper)
   - Specific branded asset names (USDC, stETH, wstETH) — say "stablecoin", "wrapped staking receipt"
   Use canonical DeFi roles: "liquidity vault", "AMM pool", "collateralized debt position", etc.

2. **Cluster aggressively.** If the report describes multiple aspects of the same exploit mechanism
   (e.g. accounting asymmetry in both deposit AND redeem paths), emit ONE semantic capturing
   the shared root cause. The number of distinct semantics should stay small.

3. **Be concrete.** Preserve technical details from the report — specific accounting formulas,
   state variable names, call sequences. These are what make the pattern reusable.

4. **Be thorough within this report** but stay project-agnostic. Cross-project merging will
   deduplicate later.

## Tool Usage

Use these tools to stream out the extraction (do NOT emit free-form JSON):
- `emit_semantic({{name, definition, description, category, functions: [{{name, contract, signature?}}, …]}})` — call once for each distinct exploit pattern you identify in this report. Cluster aggressively; emit one call per *distinct* pattern.
- `finalize_semantic_extraction({{summary?}})` — call exactly once when this report has been fully covered (or when it contains no meaningful exploit patterns — call finalize directly without any `emit_semantic`). After this, stop emitting tool calls.

## Semantic Data

### Existing Semantics in Knowledge Base

{existing_semantics}

### Newly Extracted Semantics (from the current project)

{new_semantics}

## Instructions

For every newly extracted semantic listed above, decide whether it should:
- **MERGE** into one or more existing canonical semantics in the knowledge base, OR
- be admitted as a **NEW** canonical semantic (emit `merge_target_ids: []`).

### Decision Criteria

The judgement must be grounded in the *concrete behavioural details* in
each side's `Description` field — which state variables are mutated, which
access controls gate them, what external boundaries are crossed, what
invariants are enforced. Surface-level theme overlap ("both involve admin",
"both manage parameters", "both touch deposits") is NOT a sufficient reason
to merge.

**MERGE only when:**
- The same concrete state variable(s) are mutated under the same accounting
  semantics (additive / multiplicative / replace-on-checkpoint, etc).
- The same external-call failure modes apply (revert vs swallowed vs caught).
- The same access-control shape gates the entry (single owner, role with
  specific permission, signature gate, …) AND it gates the same kind of
  state mutation.
- The pre-condition state and post-condition state are equivalent in
  concrete terms, not just in narrative.
- The semantic category is the same.

**Otherwise emit NEW** (empty `merge_target_ids`):
- A different concrete state-mutation accounting, even if the broad theme
  overlaps.
- A different external-boundary failure mode.
- A different access-control surface.
- A new financial primitive not covered by any existing semantic.

When in doubt: **prefer NEW**. A precise canonical capturing one specific
behaviour is more useful than a vague canonical loosely covering many.

### Canonical Identity is Locked

When you choose to MERGE, the target canonical's `name` and `definition`
are NEVER modified by your decision — they are the canonical's stable
identity. If the new raw's behaviour cannot be naturally described under
the existing canonical's name + definition, emit `merge_target_ids: []`
(NEW) instead of trying to fit the raw under it.

The canonical's `name` + `definition` already carry the abstract concept.
`updated_description` exists ONLY to keep the description a CONCRETE,
representative one — never to generalize. Supply it only when this raw's
description is strictly more concrete / complete / precise than the
canonical's current one (names more specific state variables, gates, or
failure modes), as a full self-contained REPLACEMENT of comparable length.
OMIT it when the existing description already covers the raw, merely
restates it, or would only get broader. NEVER broaden the description
toward a generic category label (e.g. "improper access control") — that
erases the concrete signal that makes the canonical useful.

Instead, every MERGE MUST carry `appended_description`: one or two
sentences saying how THIS raw *extends* the canonical it folds into — the
concrete delta it adds (a new state variable it also touches, a different
gate, an extra failure mode). This note is stored on the merge edge, so the
canonical description stays a tight representative while each folded
variant's specifics are preserved per-edge. Do not restate the shared
concept; name only what is NEW in this raw.

### Examples

✓ Good merge:
  raw description: "increments `s_depositedAssets` additively by `assets`
    before `transferFrom`; reverts on `paused`; minted shares =
    `previewDeposit(assets)`"
  canonical description: "Vault.deposit increments `s_depositedAssets`
    additively prior to `safeTransferFrom`; gated by `whenNotPaused`;
    shares = `previewDeposit`"
  → MERGE: same state variable (`s_depositedAssets`), same accounting
    (additive before transfer), same gate (`whenNotPaused`).

✗ Bad merge (must be NEW):
  raw description: "Owner-gated `setOracleFeed(address)` updates
    `s_priceFeed` mapping for one collateral; emits `OracleFeedUpdated`."
  canonical description: "Owner-gated `setRouter(address)` updates the
    swap-router reference; reverts on zero-address."
  Theme overlap: "owner-gated setter, single state variable update".
  But: different state variable (`s_priceFeed` vs `s_router`), different
  invariants, different downstream consumers.
  → NEW: theme overlap is not a behavioural anchor.

## Tool Usage

Use these tools (do NOT emit free-form JSON):
- `emit_semantic_merge_decision({{reason, new_semantic_name, merge_target_ids, updated_description?, appended_description?}})` — call exactly once for each `new_semantic_name` listed in the prompt above. Set `merge_target_ids: []` for NEW; set it to one or more existing canonical IDs (from this chunk's prompt) for MERGE. `updated_description` (optional, merge-only) is a full replacement supplied ONLY to make the canonical's description more concrete/complete — never to generalize; omit it to keep the existing one. `appended_description` is REQUIRED on every MERGE: one or two sentences on how this raw extends the canonical (omit only for NEW).
- `finalize_semantic_merge({{summary?}})` — call exactly once after every newly-extracted semantic has been decided. Stop afterwards.

## Instructions

The underlying project for this report has already been categorized as: {known_categories}

Extract the unique vulnerability findings described in the audit material above.

### Definition of Vulnerability Pattern

For each finding, capture:
1. **title**: Keep the original report title when one is available.
2. **root_cause**: The technical and economic root cause. Cite the specific accounting step / state mutation / call ordering / failure-mode that constitutes the bug, not abstract metaphor. E.g. "`swap()` reads `s_reserves` to compute `minimumOut` but allows `setFeeInfo` to mutate the live fee schedule between blocks, so a victim swap is priced under the new fee schedule" — not just "missing slippage check".
3. **description**: Concrete description of the vulnerable behavioural shape and its impact, in terms of state pre- and post-condition. Include WHICH state variables drift, WHO can drive them off-invariant, and WHAT downstream paths consume the corrupted state.
4. **severity**: One of `High`, `Medium`, or `Low` using the severity definitions above.
5. **patterns**: The specific state variables / call orderings / external failure modes / control-flow shapes that constitute the bug. Cite Solidity-level details (e.g. "`transferFrom` is called BEFORE the reserve update; reentrancy guard is per-pool not per-router") rather than English summaries ("missing reentrancy guard").
6. **exploits**: Concrete attack sequence in terms of `(msg.sender, function, observed state, ordering vs other tx)`. Make it reproducible: a future reader should be able to translate the prose into an explicit transaction sequence.
7. **category**: Exactly one top-level vulnerability category from the taxonomy.
8. **subcategory**: Exactly one subcategory from the chosen top-level category.

### Critical Rules

0. **Hard rule on abstraction.** Outside the `title` field, the `root_cause`, `description`, `patterns`, and `exploits` fields MUST NOT include any of:
   - Specific protocol or project names (Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Tempus, Pendle, BentoBox, …).
   - Specific contract names (UniswapV2Pair, BentoBoxV1, …).
   - Specific function signatures or library APIs (`depositAndFix(...)`, `swapExactTokensForTokens(...)`).
   - Specific branded asset names (USDC, DAI, stETH, …) — say "stablecoin", "wrapped staking receipt", etc. instead.
   Use only abstract roles like "AMM swap helper", "external principal-token integration", "liquidation keeper", "signature forwarder", "shared collateral vault", "yield strategy adapter". The `title` field is the only place where the original report wording is preserved verbatim.
1. Deduplicate repeated mentions of the same finding inside this material chunk.
2. **Atomic decomposition.** If a single original finding describes ≥2 independently triggerable vulnerability mechanisms (e.g., "uses the wrong return value AND skips slippage validation"; "missing access control AND missing zero-address check on the same setter"), emit one record per mechanism. The records share the same `title` (original report title) but each record's `root_cause`, `patterns`, and `exploits` MUST describe one mechanism only. The decision criterion is functional independence: if fixing one mechanism would still leave the other independently exploitable on a different project, the mechanisms are independent and must be split.
3. Include economically meaningful root causes when the bug depends on incentives, liquidity flow, or bridge accounting.
4. Do not invent findings that are not supported by the material above.
5. Always use a subcategory name exactly as written in the taxonomy.

## Tool Usage

Use these tools to stream out the extraction (do NOT emit free-form JSON):
- `emit_finding({{title, severity, category, subcategory, root_cause, description, patterns, exploits}})` — call once per *atomic* vulnerability mechanism. If one original report finding decomposes into multiple independent mechanisms, share the same `title` across the calls but populate `root_cause` / `patterns` / `exploits` independently for each.
- `finalize_finding_extraction({{summary?}})` — call exactly once when every distinct finding in this chunk has been emitted (or when the chunk contains no findings — call finalize directly without `emit_finding`). Stop afterwards.

## Instructions

The underlying protocol for this report has been categorized as: {known_categories}

Extract concrete vulnerability findings from the security report above.

### Handling Different Report Formats

- **Audit reports** with explicit "## Severity", "## Description", "## Impact" sections →
  extract one finding per vulnerability. Preserve original finding titles when available.
- **Attack analyses** without explicit finding structure →
  extract one finding covering the entire exploit.

### Per-Finding Structure

Capture:
1. **title**: Keep the original report title when available. For unstructured narratives, create a concise title summarizing the vulnerability.
2. **root_cause**: The fundamental design or implementation flaw. Cite the specific accounting step / state mutation / call ordering / assumption that was violated. E.g. "Share minting accounts only for position liquidity L, not the vault's full asset inventory (pending fees, retained balances, compound dust)" — not just "share pricing bug".
3. **description**: The full exploit mechanism — what goes wrong, how, and why. Combine the report's Description and Impact sections. Include: what invariant was violated, the sequence of steps that trigger the bug, what state drifts, and concrete consequences.
4. **severity**: One of `High`, `Medium`, or `Low` using the severity definitions above. If the report states severity explicitly, use it. Otherwise infer: loss of funds → High, griefing / denial of service → Medium, informational design issues → Low.
5. **patterns**: Concrete exploit patterns used. If a PoC is provided, summarize the exploitation steps. Reference specific functions, state variables, and control-flow shapes cited in the report. E.g. "Depositor calls `deposit()` while `claimableUsdc < AUTO_COMPOUND_MIN_USDC` → `_compound()` skipped → retained fees from prior epoch are folded into new depositor's shares at next compound."
6. **exploits**: The actual attack sequence in reproducible detail. A future reader should be able to translate the prose into an explicit transaction sequence. If the report provides a PoC, capture its key steps here.
7. **category**: Exactly one top-level vulnerability category from the taxonomy.
8. **subcategory**: Exactly one subcategory from the chosen top-level category.

### Critical Rules

0. **Hard rule on abstraction.** Outside the `title` field, fields MUST NOT include:
   - Specific protocol/project names
   - Specific contract names
   - Specific branded asset names (say "stablecoin", "wrapped staking receipt")
   Use only abstract roles.
1. If the report describes multiple independently triggerable vulnerability mechanisms, emit one record per mechanism. They share the same `title` but each record's `root_cause`, `patterns`, and `exploits` describe one mechanism only.
2. Do not invent findings not supported by the report.
3. Always use a subcategory name exactly as written in the taxonomy.
4. Deduplicate repeated mentions of the same finding.

## Tool Usage

Use these tools to stream out the extraction (do NOT emit free-form JSON):
- `emit_finding({{title, severity, category, subcategory, root_cause, description, patterns, exploits}})` — call once per distinct vulnerability mechanism.
- `finalize_finding_extraction({{summary?}})` — call exactly once when every distinct finding has been emitted. Stop afterwards.

## Instructions

The report's protocol has been categorized as: {known_categories}

Extract both reusable exploit-pattern semantics and atomic vulnerability findings from the report above in one pass. The report may contain an overview, vulnerable or reconstructed code, an attack flow, a PoC, a classification table, remediation, lessons, and on-chain verification. Treat those sections as evidence for the same report, not as separate incidents.

### Semantics

Emit one semantic for each distinct reusable exploit mechanism. Keep names, definitions, and descriptions project-agnostic, but preserve concrete state variables, functions, call ordering, assumptions, and prerequisites in the description. Every semantic needs at least one function reference; use `_narrative` and the report filename when no function is named.

### Findings

Emit one finding for each independently triggerable vulnerability mechanism. If a classification table gives IDs such as V-01, V-02, or V-03, preserve each independently supported row as a separate finding even when several findings share one attack. Do not collapse a prerequisite, missing defense, bypass condition, or separately exploitable impact mechanism into a generic report-level finding. Conversely, do not create a finding for a venue or dependency explicitly described as not vulnerable, such as an exchange pool used only to exit minted or stolen assets. Do not treat remediation, lessons, or comparison incidents as new findings.

Use the original report title for related findings when no more specific title exists. Preserve explicit severity when the report states it; otherwise infer from impact. Respect the report's own distinction between verified, inferred, reconstructed, estimated, superseded, and unconfirmed evidence in the finding prose. Never invent a transaction, address, code fact, or vulnerability absent from the report.

### Links

After emitting all semantics and findings, link every finding to one or more semantics that describe the business logic required to reproduce it. A finding may link to several semantics. Link IDs must refer to records emitted in this chunk. Use IDs in the `sem-<ordinal>` and `finding-<ordinal>` formats; the extractor will namespace them for this chunk.

### Tool Usage

Use only these tools; do not emit free-form JSON:
- `emit_narrative_semantic({{id, name, definition, description, category, functions: [{{name, contract, signature?}}, …]}})` — once per distinct exploit-pattern semantic.
- `emit_narrative_finding({{id, title, severity, category, subcategory, root_cause, description, patterns, exploits}})` — once per atomic vulnerability mechanism, including independently supported classification-table rows.
- `link_narrative_finding({{finding_id, semantic_ids}})` — after the referenced records exist; every finding must have at least one semantic.
- `finalize_narrative_extraction({{summary?}})` — exactly once after all records and links are emitted.

## Project Semantics (candidates)

Each candidate is identified by its zero-based index `S`. The list below contains every DeFi semantic this project implements; pick from these only.

{semantics_block}

## Project Findings

Each finding is identified by its zero-based index `F`. These findings come from the project's own audit report.

{findings_block}

## Instructions

For every finding F, return the list of semantic indices S whose business logic is needed to reproduce or trigger that finding. Be expansive when the relationship is plausible.

### Hard rules

- Every finding must appear in the output exactly once.
- Every finding's `semantic_indices` array must contain at least ONE index. Findings cannot be left unlinked at this stage; if no semantic looks right, pick the closest "Utility/Admin" or whichever semantic supplies the contract surface where the bug lives.
- Use only `S` indices that appear in the candidate list above.
- A finding may link to multiple semantics — list them all.

## Existing Findings in Knowledge Base

{existing_findings}

## Newly Extracted Findings

{new_findings}

## Instructions

For each newly extracted finding, decide whether it should be merged with one or more existing findings in the knowledge base or added as a new finding (emit `merge_target_ids: []`).

### Merge Criteria

The judgement must be grounded in the *concrete details* in each side's
`Root Cause`, `Patterns`, and `Exploits` fields — the specific accounting
step / state variable drift / call ordering / external-boundary failure
mode that constitutes the bug. Surface theme overlap ("both involve fee
calculation", "both touch admin authority") is NOT a sufficient reason to
merge.

**MERGE only when:**
- Same concrete state-variable drift (e.g. both bugs cause
  `s_depositedAssets` to track > actual token balance).
- Same exploit-shape: ordering of calls / conditions / oracle assumptions
  reproducible to the same attacker setup.
- Same vulnerability taxonomy category AND closely matching subcategory.

**Otherwise emit NEW** (empty `merge_target_ids`):
- Different state variable affected.
- Different attacker entry point (different `msg.sender` setup, different
  ordering, different external boundary).
- Different taxonomy category or substantially different subcategory.

When in doubt: **prefer NEW**. A precise canonical finding capturing one
specific bug pattern is more useful than a vague canonical that loosely
covers many.

### Canonical Identity is Locked

When you MERGE, the target canonical's `title`, `severity`, and
`root_cause` are NEVER modified — they are the canonical's stable
identity. The canonical's `title`/`severity`/`root_cause` already carry the abstract
identity, so `updated_description` / `updated_patterns` / `updated_exploits`
exist ONLY to keep those fields CONCRETE and representative — never to
generalize. Supply a field only when this raw's value is strictly more
concrete / complete / precise than the canonical's current one, as a full
self-contained REPLACEMENT of comparable length. OMIT a field when the
existing value already covers the raw, merely restates it, or would only
get broader. NEVER broaden a field toward a generic category label — that
erases the concrete signal.

Instead, every MERGE MUST carry `appended_description`, `appended_patterns`,
and `appended_exploits` (all in the same call): one or two sentences each on
how THIS raw *extends* the canonical's description / patterns / exploits — the
concrete delta it adds (a different state-variable drift, a distinct attacker
entry or ordering, an extra failure mode). These notes are stored on the merge
edge, so the canonical fields stay tight while each folded variant's specifics
are preserved per-edge. Name only what is NEW in this raw; if this raw adds
nothing new to one of the three, say so explicitly (e.g. "no new exploit
vector beyond the canonical").

If the new raw's bug shape cannot be expressed under the existing target's
title/severity/root_cause, emit `merge_target_ids: []` (NEW) instead.

## Tool Usage

Use these tools (do NOT emit free-form JSON):
- `emit_finding_merge_decision({{reason, new_finding_title, merge_target_ids, updated_description?, updated_patterns?, updated_exploits?, appended_description?, appended_patterns?, appended_exploits?}})` — call exactly once for each `new_finding_title` listed in the prompt above. Empty `merge_target_ids` = NEW; one or more IDs = MERGE. The `updated_*` fields (optional, merge-only) are full replacements supplied ONLY to make a canonical field more concrete/complete — never to generalize; omit any to keep the existing one. `appended_description` / `appended_patterns` / `appended_exploits` are ALL REQUIRED on every MERGE: one or two sentences each on how this raw extends the canonical's description / patterns / exploits (omit only for NEW).
- `finalize_finding_merge({{summary?}})` — call exactly once after every newly-extracted finding has been decided. Stop afterwards.

## Candidate Semantics

"#;

pub const FINDING_LINK_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_OUTPUT: &str = r#"
## Instructions

For each finding below, decide which candidate semantics from the list
above the finding has at least a tangential relation to, and emit a
strength-tagged entry per such candidate. Candidates with NO meaningful
relation can be omitted entirely — silent omission is treated as "no
link" for that pair. The candidate set per prompt is large, so be
selective; you do NOT need to enumerate Low entries for clearly unrelated
candidates.

### Link budget — selectivity is the deliverable

  - Emit AT MOST the 2 strongest entries per finding. The single best
    entry is usually the right answer; add a second only when it is
    equally direct. Never enumerate every candidate a finding brushes
    against.
  - NO-LINK IS THE EXPECTED OUTCOME for most findings: an empty
    `semantic_evidence` list is a correct, common answer — not a
    failure. Do NOT pad entries because few findings are in this batch
    or because a candidate merely shares a topic.
  - Emit a `Low` only when the tangential tie is SPECIFIC — a named
    precondition, setUp step, or shared sub-step you can point to.
    "Same broad area / same category" alone deserves SILENCE, not a
    Low. (Low remains the correct demotion target for a tie you can
    name but that isn't a direct instantiation.)
  - The budget does NOT change the strength bar. Strength is graded by
    the rubric alone, independent of how many entries you emit: a
    finding's single best match is still `Low` or `Medium` when that
    is what the rubric says. Being the best available candidate is NOT
    evidence of `High` — most findings' best links are Medium or Low,
    and many batches contain only a handful of true Highs.

### Strength rubric — single axis: DIRECTNESS OF INSTANTIATION

Strength is determined by ONE check: how directly does this finding
instantiate the semantic's described failure mode?

  High    The finding is a textbook example of the semantic's failure
          mode. The finding's `root_cause` directly describes the
          invariant the semantic encodes being violated, AND the
          `exploits` / `patterns` cite the semantic's central behaviour
          as the attack surface. A reader of the semantic alone would
          predict this finding could exist.

  Medium  The finding touches this semantic but the bug lies on a
          DIFFERENT sub-mechanism the semantic happens to involve.
          To label Medium you must point to the specific sub-mechanism
          of the semantic the finding hits. Same category alone is NOT
          Medium — point to a concrete sub-step shared by both sides.

  Low     The finding only TANGENTIALLY touches this semantic. Common
          cases:
            - the semantic appears in setUp / preconditions but the
              actual bug is on a different code path
            - the finding's root_cause mentions the semantic only
              because it's nominally in scope
            - topic / category overlap with no concrete instantiation
              of the semantic's specific failure mode
          Most "broad topic match" links land here.

### The `additional context (from raw "<name>")` lines

A candidate semantic — or a finding — may carry a few
`— additional context (from raw "<name>"): …` lines. These are SUBORDINATE
detail about folded raws, NOT separate mechanisms to match against. Judge the
link against the canonical `Name` / `Definition` / `Description`. Matching only a
folded raw's incidental detail, or a theme that merely spans several of them, is
Low — never High.

### High-gate — anti-overclaim (apply before tagging any `High`)

  - High requires the finding's ACTUAL `root_cause` / `patterns` to instantiate
    the semantic's CENTRAL failure mode — same state, same invariant, same code
    path. Not merely the same protocol area, asset type, or topic.
  - A bug in a SHARED PRIMITIVE the semantic merely uses (ECDSA signature
    recovery, integer rounding, a reentrancy guard, an access-control modifier)
    is NOT a High instantiation of that semantic — the finding's bug must BE the
    semantic's own distinctive mechanism, not the shared primitive. Such ties are
    Medium at most; same-domain-only is Low.
  - If your `why_finding_can_fire` has to describe the SEMANTIC's mechanism to
    justify the tie (rather than quoting the FINDING's own violated invariant),
    you are on the wrong side → it is not High. When the instantiation is not
    exact, DEMOTE. Unwarranted High is the costliest error here.
  - GROUND EVERY High IN THE FINDING'S OWN TEXT. Re-read the finding's
    `root_cause` / `description` AS WRITTEN before tagging High: if the failure
    you are about to describe is not stated there — you inferred it from the
    semantic — you are PROJECTING the semantic onto the finding. That is the
    classic bad-High. When the finding's text and your evidence disagree about
    what the bug is, the finding's text wins.
  - "The semantic's protocol does X correctly; this finding omits X" is NOT
    High. The finding must exhibit the semantic's failure mode inside the same
    KIND of mechanism the semantic describes — a missing safeguard in an
    unrelated contract that merely should have had it is Medium at most,
    usually Low or silence.

### Calibrate deliberately

Unwarranted `High` poisons downstream budgets — every future consumer of
this KG that filters by strength spends tokens on edges that don't actually
instantiate the semantic. Unwarranted `Low` silently hides real bugs.

  - DEFAULT TO LOW when uncertain. No penalty for emitting Low. Real
    penalty for emitting High-or-above without concrete invariant +
    finding-text pairing.
  - CATEGORY MATCH IS NOT MEDIUM. Two records sharing DeFiCategory or
    same project domain is not, by itself, a Medium link. If your
    evidence reduces to "same area", that's Low.
  - DO NOT promote to High solely because surface keywords match. High
    requires the same FAILURE MODE, not the same vocabulary.
  - DO NOT downgrade to Low just because the finding is from a different
    project than the semantic's originating project — semantics are
    universal. Downgrade only when the finding's actual bug is not what
    the semantic encodes.

### Evidence rules

The `why_finding_can_fire` field is required per entry:

  - For **High** (>= 40 chars): state the invariant the semantic encodes
    (cite the semantic's definition/description verbatim or paraphrase)
    AND name the finding's root_cause text describing that invariant
    being violated. The pairing should be tight enough that a reader
    could verify it from just the two text blocks. Include a short
    VERBATIM fragment (>= 6 consecutive words, wrapped in double quotes)
    copied from the finding's `root_cause` or `description` that states
    this failure — if no six consecutive words in the finding's text
    state it, it is not a High. The runner MECHANICALLY CHECKS that your
    quoted fragment appears in the text of the exact finding_id you are
    emitting for; a rejection usually means you attached this evidence
    to the WRONG finding_id (mixed up two findings in the batch) —
    re-check which finding the evidence really describes.
  - For **Medium** (>= 40 chars): name the specific sub-mechanism of
    the semantic the finding hits, and explain what differs from the
    semantic's central failure mode. If you can only say "both involve
    X" without naming a sub-mechanism, demote to Low.
  - For **Low** (>= 15 chars): state where in the semantic the finding
    nominally appears (precondition / setUp / shared category) and why
    it's not a direct instantiation. Short reasons are fine.

## Tool Usage

Use these tools (do NOT emit free-form JSON):
- `emit_finding_link_decision({reasoning, finding_id, semantic_evidence: [{semantic_id, strength, why_finding_can_fire}, ...]})` — call exactly once per `finding_id` listed below. `semantic_evidence` is a list of decisions for candidates the finding is at least tangentially related to (Low or higher); omit candidates with no meaningful relation. An empty list means "no link" for this finding. `strength` is one of `High`, `Medium`, `Low`; `why_finding_can_fire` cites the specific behaviour from the semantic's description (or — for Low — names where the semantic only tangentially appears).
- `finalize_finding_link({summary?})` — call exactly once after every finding has been emitted.
