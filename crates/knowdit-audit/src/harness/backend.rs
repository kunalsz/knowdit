//! `HarnessBackend` — the seam between language-agnostic
//! orchestrators (`agentic fuzz`, `agentic regen`, `workflow
//! streamloop`, `workflow autoloop`) and the per-language harness
//! synthesis + execution stack. Solidity / Foundry is the
//! open-source impl shipped with this crate; additional impls
//! (e.g. additional language backends) plug in by implementing
//! this trait.
//!
//! Design notes:
//!
//! * Construction holds **settings** — which mode, where the
//!   runtime binary lives, any per-pass options equivalent to
//!   [`solidity::FuzzOptions`]. Per-call resources (`RepoDatabase`,
//!   `LLM`, the spec the caller wants regenerated) flow through
//!   method arguments. This matches how callers already thread
//!   `repo` / `llm` today.
//!
//! * No `dyn`, no callbacks — `impl Future<…> + Send` so the trait
//!   monomorphizes at every call site. Orchestrators are written as
//!   `fn run<B: HarnessBackend>(backend: &B, …)`.
//!
//! * The four entry methods exist because each granularity is
//!   independently used downstream:
//!     - `fuzz_sweep` — `agentic fuzz` / streamloop scheduler sweep.
//!     - `fuzz_one_existing_spec` — streamloop's per-spec scheduler
//!       launches one spec at a time after gen-specs.
//!     - `regen_codegen_for_spec` — `agentic regen` and streamloop's
//!       regen drain consume pending reflections.
//!     - `codegen_for_in_memory_spec` — spec-regen produces a new
//!       spec that hasn't been persisted yet; codegen runs against it
//!       and both rows commit atomically via
//!       [`knowdit_repo_model::RepoDatabase::write_full_spec_regen`].
